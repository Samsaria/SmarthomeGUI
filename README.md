# SmarthomeGUI
A non-functional web interface for a SmartHome system. Project work for the User Experience Engineering course at AAU.

# Development
As it basically a non-functional GUI prototype, I decided to keep the technology fingerprint small. As we need some reactions for user actions, this is going to be more than a static html page however. 
For the mobile version, I included jquery and simple templates for generating lists. See below for more information. If you prefer multiple HTML-pages displaying different states and results, that's fine too!  You can ignore the **Function** and **Tools** info points below in this case! ;)

## Technologies
* **Design**: Due to the requirement of a responsive and consistent design for both mobile and desktop versions, Kruemelkatze included **Material Design Lite** as style library.
+ **Function**: JQuery and the [Nano Templating Engine](https://github.com/trix/nano) are used in the mobile version. Data (devices and routines) are stored in *.json* files, which in turn are read in and get templates rendered for.
* **Tools**: (This only applies if you want to use *.json* files for data, as AJAX needs a web server. Serving html files only does not.). A *package.json* file is included **for npm-users**, using *lite-server* as an HTTP-server. Simply execute *npm install* followed by *npm start* to start the server.  **Non-npm-users** can use any HTTP-server they like. E.g. WebStorm integrated or Apache.

Also using sweetalert for nice responses ;)
Seems like an overkill? Maybe, but in my opinion it's better than wasting hours for changing static HTML pages again and again. And it makes parallel work easier!

## Folder and File Structure
Mobile stuff into /mobile, desktop stuff into /desktop. :)
Please use the respective .css file for your styles!

## Templates
Data, such as device lists, is stored in **.json** files, so that it can be easily changed and kept consistent between different pages and mobile/desktop version. These files are read in. For each list, an HTML-template has to be defined (see */mobile/overview.html* for an example). For each entry in the data, a copy of the template-element is created and filled and added to the list. For information about the template syntax, see the [Nano Templating Engine](https://github.com/trix/nano).

The templating functions are located in *common-scripts.js*. In most cases, ```createListFromFile(listSelector, templateSelector, dataFilePath)``` will be used. Call this function from your custom page script after the document is ready. E.g.:

```javascript
// This is in mobile/overview/overview.js
$(document).ready(function () {
    createListFromFile("#overview-list", ".template > li", "overviewList.json");
});
```

The respective data file (*mobile/overview/overview.js*) may look like this:
```json
[
    {
        "icon": "lightbulb_outline",
        "name": "Main light, Living Room",
        "state": "checked"
    },
    {
        "icon": "devices",
        "name": "TV, Living Room",
        "state": "checked"
    },
    {
        "icon": "format_align_justify",
        "name": "South Shutter, Living Room",
        "state": "checked"
    }
]
```
**Note**: If you want an MDL switch to be turned on, the state has to be "checked", like the HTML attribute.

The template may look like this:
```html
<div class="template">
	<li class="mdl-list__item">
		<span class="mdl-list__item-primary-content">
            <i class="material-icons  mdl-list__item-avatar md-24">{icon}</i>
            {name}
        </span>
		<span class="mdl-list__item-secondary-action">
                <label class="mdl-switch mdl-js-switch(template) mdl-js-ripple-effect" for="{templateId}">
                        <input type="checkbox" id="{templateId}" class="mdl-switch__input" {state} />
                </label>
        </span>
	</li>
</div>
```
**Note:** Each input needs an unique id. Simply use ```{templateId}``` for this, templating will handle the rest.

**NoteÂ²:** As MDL processes even hidden templates (and destroys them by doing this), you have to replace ```mdl-js-CLASS``` by ```mdl-js-CLASS(template)``` in your templates, so that MDL does not change them. See the example with ```mdl-js-switch(template)``` above.


##Json Data

#How to make Groups

Now it is only neccessary to provide the informmation (id) of the specified devices in the groups(.json) file
All data will be retrieved and  displayed in the groups page.
If you want to define further groups just do it in the json file and provide in the {devices}-Object the device ids.
Unfortunately they must be specified at the devices json.


#TODO
Store the checked or unchecked JSON states!!!!!
